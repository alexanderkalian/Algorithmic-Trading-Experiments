Exploratory Python scripts for gauging algorithmic trading opportunities and quantifying them - mostly to do with cryptocurrencies. Own project.

A lot of the work I am doing on this is competitive and so is not being shared here - rather, this repo contains a cutting-pile of useful and interesting, yet not entirely monetisable scripts.
